| **Purpose**               | Demonstrate NE filesystem cleanup using Network Supervision lookups, managed CLI (MD and Classic), TextFSM parsing, and Python age calculation.                          |
| **Technologies Involved** | Mistral workflows, `nsp.https`, `nsp.managed_cli`, `nsp.textFSM`, `nsp.python`, schemaForm / Input Forms, Network Supervision REST API.                                   |

## Introduction

**Short description:** This example provides a proof-of-concept Mistral workflow that cleans old files from the compact flash (CF) of an NSP-managed SR OS device. It supports both model-driven (MD) and Classic (NFM-P) managed devices and is intended for customers, partners, and engineers learning Workflow Manager patterns for NE maintenance.

**Problem statement:** Activity or logging directories on SR OS compact flash can fill with aged files. Operators need a safe, repeatable way to identify deletion candidates (with dry-run support), skip critical system files, and apply the correct CLI delete/remove commands depending on whether the NE is MD or Classic managed. This example shows how to do that with a single workflow.

---

## Pre-requisites

- **NSP:** NSP 25.8 with Workflow Manager (WFM) enabled.
- **Access and roles:** Developer mode enabled; ability to create, publish, and execute workflows (Developer or Operator role as required by your environment).
- **External systems:** At least one SR OS NE managed by NSP (MD via MDM and/or Classic via NFM-P) with a target CF directory such as `cf3:/act`.
- **Tools or skills:** Basic YAML and JSON; familiarity with the NSP Workflows UI or WFM REST API; optional: VS Code with the NSP workflows plugin, Postman or curl.
- **Other:** Lab or non-production NE recommended. Do not hardcode credentials; use NSP session authentication and placeholders in examples.

---

## Solution Overview

- **High-level design:** The `cleanupCFlash` workflow has these tasks: resolve the NE with `nsp.https` (`getNeIP`); list files with `nsp.managed_cli` on MD or Classic paths; parse the listing with `nsp.textFSM`; compute ages and build delete commands with `nsp.python` (honouring `dryRun` and an exception list); delete candidates when not dry-running; then close the CLI session.

- **Step-by-step guide:**

  1. **Create or import the workflow definition.** Use the VS Code NSP workflows plugin or the NSP UI (**Workflows** → **+ Workflow**). Paste or import [`7x50-CF-cleanup-workflow.yaml`](./7x50-CF-cleanup-workflow.yaml), then **Validate & Update Flow** and **Create**.

  2. **(Optional) Add a short README in the NSP UI.** From the workflow **⋮** menu choose **View info**, edit the **Readme** tab, and describe inputs (`neName`, `dir`, `deleteAge`) and `dryRun` support.

  3. **Publish the workflow.** On the workflow info page, use **Modify state** to set it to **Published**.

  4. **(Optional) Add an Input Form (schemaForm).** In the workflow **Input Form** section, enter:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  - name: neName
    title: NE Name
    columnSpan: 2
    newRow: true
    readOnly: false
    required: true
    type: string
    component:
      input: autoComplete
    suggest:
      action: nspWebUI.neList
      name:
        - neName
  - name: dir
    title: DIR
    description: Target directory
    columnSpan: 4
    newRow: true
    readOnly: false
    required: false
    type: string
    default: cf3:/act
    validations:
      patterns: []
  - name: deleteAge
    title: DELETE AGE
    description: Minimum age of file in seconds
    columnSpan: 4
    newRow: true
    readOnly: false
    required: false
    type: number
    default: 3600
```

  5. **Execute the workflow.** Supply input such as:

```json
{
  "neName": "<NE_NAME>",
  "dir": "cf3:/act",
  "deleteAge": 3600
}
```

Start with `dryRun: true`. From the UI use the Input Form, or call the WFM REST API:

```json
POST https://<NSP_IP>/wfm/api/v1/execution
content-type: application/json

{
    "workflow_id": "cleanupCFlash",
    "input": {
        "neName": "<NE_NAME>",
        "dir": "cf3:/act",
        "deleteAge": 3600
    },
    "params": {
        "env": "DefaultEnv",
        "options": {
            "dryRun": true,
            "force": false,
            "notifyKafka": true
        }
    },
    "output": {},
    "notifyKafka": true
}
```

Example successful output:

```yaml
files:
  - NAME: four.txt
    SIZE: '5'
    TIMEDATE: 10/23/2025  03:50p
  - NAME: three.txt
    SIZE: '5'
    TIMEDATE: 10/23/2025  03:01p
success: true
```

Workflow inputs: `neName` (required), `dir` (default `cf3:/act`), `deleteAge` in seconds (default `3600`), plus the standard WFM `dryRun` option. Critical filenames in the Python `exceptList` (for example `BOF.CFG`, `CONFIG.CFG`, `NVRAM.DAT`, and selected TIM/boot images) are never deleted—review that list before any non–dry-run use.

---

## Conclusion

You now have a workflow that cleans aged files from SR OS compact flash using `cleanupCFlash`, with MD and Classic paths, dry-run preview, and an optional schemaForm Input Form. Adapt the directory, age threshold, and exception list for your own lab or OSS use cases.

## Security and operations

This tutorial is a proof of concept and an example method for cleaning compact flash on an NSP-managed SR OS device. It is not designed to be implemented as-is in a production network. Prefer dry-run first, validate against your NSP release, review exception lists and target directories, and never commit credentials or environment-specific secrets into the repository.
